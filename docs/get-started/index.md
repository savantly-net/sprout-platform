The Sprout Platform provides an extensible and modular application platform, suitable for custom CMS, line-of-business, application portals, or other types of apps.  

You can use the default server, or add the [Sprout Starter Library](https://github.com/savantly-net/sprout-platform/tree/master/backend/starters/sprout-spring-boot-starter) to your own Spring Boot project.  
It can be used headless, but a default UI is provided which is customizable via plugins.  

It's opinionated, but the default configurations can be backed off - so you can use as much or as little as you want.
